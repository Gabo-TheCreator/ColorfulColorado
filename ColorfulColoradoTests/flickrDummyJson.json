It was nice to get out and about to enjoy some fresh mountain air, and as always, some fabulous scenery. Of course, it wouldn't be springtime in the mountains without a few snowy days and looks like we are expecting over 2 feet of snow later this week. <br \/> <br \/> Have a fantastic week!!!!<\/p>",
